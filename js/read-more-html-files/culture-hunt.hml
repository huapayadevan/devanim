Culture Hunt
<p>
    The idea for Culture Hunt came from the idea of being able to make cultural engagement into a game. It uses the Google Maps API in order to showcase different cultural sights in the Houston area. When the user click on a location they are presented with information about that location, such as a description, open hours, and a picture. The user can then select to "check-in," at which point the device they are on would call the Google Maps API again to test their location. If the user is close to the area they get points which contribute to their over all score so that they may compete to be the must culturally traveled in the Houston area, or just have fun seeing sights.

    Since the Houston Hackathon, the Boniuk Institute at Rice University has organized a team who are working to make the culture hunt idea fully operational. I and 7 other people meet on a regular basis to discuss where we want the app to go, and what each of us can do to contribute.

    Following is a link to an early version of the game. Please be sure to share your location for the game to work properly. Also, everything is in the Houston area, please keep that in mind as well.
