			                The idea for Culture Hunt came from the idea of being able to make cultural engagement into a game. It uses the Google Maps API in order to showcase different cultural sights in the Houston area. When the user click on a location they are presented with information about that location, such as a description, open hours, and a picture. The user can then select to "check-in," at which point the device they are on would call the Google Maps API again to test their location. If the user is close to the area they get points which contribute to their overall score so that they may compete to be the most culturally traveled in the Houston area, or just have fun seeing sights.\

                            Smart App was a web app created at the A&M student run hackathon "Hackerbowl." The purpose of app was to help the user set and organize "S.M.A.R.T." goals. The app would walk the user through the process of setting goals, and then user could check back in on a regular basis and get points for working towards their goals. The app idea was simple, yet elegant in design. \

					A ray tracer is a way of modeling the way that three dimensional objects in a space that interact with light. Following each light ray as it reflects of off each object, reflects onto other objects, and eventually reaches the viewer. A backwards ray tracer follows the path of each light ray from the eye to each light source. \

							The HDC Tools project, is a project that I worked on for the Texas A&M Central Help Desk that I had initiated and worked on. The purpose of the project was to redesign an outdated system that the Help Desk is using in order to represent our scheduling system in a easy to read, mobile friendly manner. \

		                    Sign-2-Line is an app that I made with 2 other Texas A&M students at LSU's first hackathon 'GeauxHack.' The purpose of the app is to translate American Sign Language into text using the <a target='_blank' class='obvious-link' href='https://www.leapmotion.com/'>Leap Motion.</a> We managed to code around 10 different phrases that the Leap Motion detected, and printed to the screen.  \

		                    In addition to translating ASL, we used the SendGrid api to add the ability to email a record of the translation to a user, so that they can keep track of their conversations. \
